Dr. Moghairib is a research associate at the University of Calgary - Computational Hydrology Research Group in Calgary, Alberta, CA. He is also a registered Professional Engineer (P.Eng.) in Saskatchewan, CA, with more than 4 years of international work experience as a hydrologic and hydrogeologic engineer.
Dr. Moghairib is currently leading and managing a couple of projects that are funded under the Global Water Futures program ([GWF](https://gwf.usask.ca/)).

Current research involves the development of new conceptual, empirical, and physical methods to improve the performance of various hydrologic models in simulating cold region processes, with emphasis on the North American prairie region. The research also involves simulating the flooding extents under future climate change for multiple locations across Western Canada.
